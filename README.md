# Reinforcement Learning for Blackjack Strategy

Welcome to my project on devising the best playing strategy for Blackjack using Reinforcement Learning! In this project, I have implemented Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning algorithms to determine the optimum Blackjack strategy.

## Introduction

Blackjack is a popular casino card game that has been studied extensively to develop strategies for improving the likelihood of winning. By leveraging Reinforcement Learning, we can determine the best strategy for playing Blackjack efficiently. This project demonstrates how Reinforcement Learning, particularly Monte Carlo methods, can be applied to this classic game.

## Objectives

- **Understand the basics of Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
- **Implement Monte Carlo RL algorithms**
- **Apply RL to determine the optimal strategy for Blackjack**
- **Utilize OpenAI's Gym framework for the RL environment**

## Key Concepts

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
- **Monte Carlo Methods:** A class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results, particularly useful for RL when dealing with episodic tasks like Blackjack.
- **OpenAI Gym:** A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides various environments, including Blackjack, for testing and experimentation.

## Implementation

### Environment

OpenAI's Gym provides a versatile framework for Reinforcement Learning. For this project, we use the Gym's Blackjack environment, which simulates the game and allows our RL agent to interact with it.

### Algorithm

We employ Monte Carlo methods to develop our Blackjack strategy. The algorithm involves:
1. **Exploring the environment:** The agent plays multiple games of Blackjack to collect data.
2. **Evaluating actions:** The agent uses the collected data to evaluate the quality of its actions based on the rewards received.
3. **Improving policy:** The agent updates its strategy to favor actions that yield higher rewards, gradually converging to the optimal strategy.

### Results

After training the RL agent using Monte Carlo methods, we observe a significant improvement in the playing strategy. The agent learns to make decisions that maximize its chances of winning, demonstrating the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning in solving complex decision-making problems.
